# ScrollViews and Gestures
Inspired by WWDC14 Session 235 "Advanced Scrollviews and Touch Handling Techniques"
by Josh Shaffer and Eliza Block.

Unfortunately Apple didn't provide the sample code of this session, so we made our own :-)

# CocoaHeadsFFM

The code was created at this event: [CocoaheadsFFM Meetup August 2014](https://www.facebook.com/events/1435115283436575/?ref_notif_type=event_mall_comment&source=1)
